# 1. Review of metal behaviours

According to [Skjelkvåle *et al*. (2006)](https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/handle/11250/213255), the main (non-point) sources of metals influencing surface water concentrations in Norway are:

 * **Geological**. Metals are derived directly from the weathering of bedrock and surficial deposits

 * **Atmospheric**. Metals may be transported from elsewhere in Europe as “long-range, transboundary air pollution” (LRTAP), or from local sources within or near Norwegian borders. LRTAP is particularly important in Southern Norway

The relative importance of these sources is different for different metals. Historically, As, Cd, Hg, Pb and Zn have been primarily determined by LRTAP, whereas Cr, Cu and Ni have been mostly influenced by geology (except close to the Russian border, where Cu and Ni are strongly affected by local industry). Furthermore, the mobility of metals derived from these sources is influenced by the following factors:

 * **Water chemistry**. Some elements are more easily mobilised at lower pH, and many metals form complexes with organic matter, leading to higher concentrations in areas with high total organic carbon (TOC; [Groenenberg *et al*., 2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-017-9508-1_9))

 * **Hydrology**. Short residence times and/or high water fluxes mean reduced contact time between water and soil, leading to lower metal concentrations. Sedimentation rates are also important, as a high proportion of the total metal load is transported in solid phases ([Vink and Peters, 2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.1286))

Key factors believed to determine surface water concentrations for the eight metals of interest are summarised in *Table 1*.

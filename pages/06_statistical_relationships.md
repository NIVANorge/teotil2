## 3.3. Statistical relationships

TEOTIL Metals is underpinned by the idea that significant relationships exist between key sources/drivers of metal inputs (geology, atmospheric deposition, hydrology and point discharges) and the fluxes observed in surface waters. To test this, statistical models were developed linking the 1995 water chemistry dataset to a range of possible explanatory variables. This preliminary analysis considered only the metals As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Cd and Hg were not considered, as they are missing one or more of the required input datasets. The following variables were incorporated:

 * **Water chemistry**. Concentrations of metals [μg/l], plus TOC [mgC/l] and pH [-] were extracted from the database for the 1995 lake survey. Catchment boundaries representing the area upstream of 960 of these lakes were also obtained

 * **Geology**. The mean metal concentration [mg/kg] measured in river sediments was calculated for each catchment by averaging IDW interpolated values within each catchment boundary (Fig. 2b)

 * **Atmospheric deposition**. The IDW interpolated moss dataset from 1990 (Fig. 3b) was averaged over each catchment to obtain values proportional to deposition inputs [mg/kg]

 * **Hydrology**. The NVE flows dataset for 1995 was spatially distributed to estimate average annual runoff [mm] in each lake catchment

 * **Point sources**. Locations for all sites permitted to discharge metals were extracted from the Environment Agency’s licensing database and assigned to each lake catchment

## 3.4. Direct estimates of metal concentrations

Poor statistical relationships (except when incorporating pH and TOC) and incomplete historic datasets make it difficult to use the moss and geochemistry surveys to derive export coefficients and retention factors for TEOTIL2 Metals ([Section 3.3](06_statistical_relationships.html)). However, the 2019 1000 Lakes survey provides a detailed picture of the spatial distribution of metal concentrations in Norwegian freshwaters. To some extent, this dataset can be used to bypass challenges with the moss and geochemistry data: since we already know the concentrations in surface waters, it is not necessary to allow for catchment level retention (i.e. retention can be assumed to be 0; [Section 3.2.2](05_retention.html)); it is also no longer necessary to derive export coefficients from the "geology" and "depositon" datasets (because direct estimates of concentrations are available instead).

The downside of this approach is that it cannot distinguish between inputs from bedrock weathering versus atmospheric deposition. This is unfortunate, as one of the main benefits of models such as TEOTIL is the ability to perform "source apportionment" i.e. to separate total fluxes into several contributing components. However, in the case of TEOTIL Metals, we have no chocie but to assume that geochemical concentrations are constant, because there there is only one geochemical survey dataset (from 1984/5). Rather than attempting to separate the bedrock weathering and atmospheric depositon components using poor statistical relationships, it may therefore be better to estimate the combined (weathering + deposition) component directly from the water chemistry data, and then further assume that changes in this component are driven primarily by atmospheric depositon, rather than bedrock weathering. This approach simultaneously solves the problems of estimating retention factors and export coefficients and, although conceptually different to the way nutrients are handled in TEOTIL, it is nevertheless similar to how the model estimates catchment-level water fluxes.

### 3.4.1. 2019 concentrations from the "1000 Lakes" survey

Metal concentrations measured by the 2019 1000 Lakes survey are assumed to reflect a combination of point discharges (e.g. from industry) and diffuse inputs from bedrock weathering and atmospheric depositon. The notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NIVANorge/teotil2/blob/main/notebooks/dev03_teotil2_metals_1k_lakes_2019.ipynb) first identifies 947 stations from the 1000 Lakes dataset with no upstream point discharges based on data supplied by the Norwegian Environment Agency. Data from just these lakes were then [spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting (IDW)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NIVANorge/teotil2/blob/main/notebooks/dev03_teotil2_metals_1k_lakes_2019.ipynb#4.-Interpolate-1000-Lakes-dataset) and mean concentrations calculated for each metal in each regine catchment using [zonal statistics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NIVANorge/teotil2/blob/main/notebooks/dev03_teotil2_metals_1k_lakes_2019.ipynb#7.-Zonal-statistics).

A [prototype TEOTIL2 Metals model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NIVANorge/teotil2/blob/main/notebooks/dev03_teotil2_metals_1k_lakes_2019.ipynb#8.-Build-and-test-TEOTIL2-model-for-metals-in-2019) for 2019 was constructed by combining the estimated "diffuse" inputs with data on point discharges. This model was then used to simulate fluxes for the 20 "main rivers" monitoried as part of Elveovervåkingsprogrammet during 2019. *Fig. 6* compares output from the experimental TEOTIL2 model with observed fluxes (left column), and also shows results obtained by simply summing all point discharges, which is the current method used for e.g. OSPAR reporting (right column).

***Fig. 6:*** The left column of plots shows output from TEOTIL2 Metals for 2019; the right column is the sum of point discharges only (i.e. the current "default" method for OSPAR reporting). The x-axis in all plots shows observed fluxes calcuated as part of Elveovervåkingsprogrammet; black lines show 1:1 relationships for comparison.

*Fig. 7* shows the same data but this time as a set of "target plots". These provide a convenient way of summarising and comparing the performance of different models: the y-axis shows **normalised bias** between simulated and observed values; the x-axis is the **unbiased, normalised root mean square difference (RMSD)**; and the distance between any point and the origin is equal to the **total RMSD**. The solid circle highlights $$RMSD = 1$$, and any point within this has positively correlated simulated and observed data series and positive [Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash%E2%80%93Sutcliffe_model_efficiency_coefficient). The dashed circle marks $$RMSD = 0.7$$ and is chosen because the area within this is approximately equal to the area of the outer "donut". **Better models therefore plot closer to the centre of the target**.

***Fig. 7:*** Target plots comparing the perfomance of the new model (red circles) to the "default" approach of summing point discharges (blue squares)

It is clear from these plots that TEOTIL2 Metals implemented using the 2019 1000 Lakes dataset is substantially better than the current "default" workflow for 2019: scatter plots for the new model show clear positive correlations for most metals, with slopes that are close to 1 in five out of eight cases. By contrast, using only point discharges dramatically underestimates observed fluxes (which is not surprising). The target plots also clearly illustrate the improved performance of the new model.

Interestingly, both sets of plots show the new model consistently underestimating metal fluxes for nickel and copper, especially in the largest rivers. This implies that either (i) mean metal concentrations estimated from the 1000 Lakes dataset do not accurately represent mean "diffuse-source" concentrations in these catchments, or (ii) substantial inputs from point sources (e.g. industry) are missing in some catchments.

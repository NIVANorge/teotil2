# Introduction

As part of a commitment to protect the marine environment of the Northeastern Atlantic, Norway estimates annual terrestrial loads for selected pollutants and submits them to the [OSPAR Commission](https://www.ospar.org/). Riverine fluxes are estimated using long-term monitoring datasets where possible, supplemented by model simulations in regions where direct observations are not available. Since the mid-1990s, the model TEOTIL ([Tjomsland *et al*., 2010](https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/handle/11250/214825)) has been used to simulate fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in unmonitored areas. This report describes work to extend TEOTIL to include metals: arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn).
